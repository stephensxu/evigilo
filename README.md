Evigilo is a minimalist API to store/track your database changes.

Evigilo is specifically designed to be used as a microservice with **zero** dependencies on your current application.

## Why?

### Why not use papertrail or any other db-centric solution?

We already have a pretty extensive messaging infrastructure at Gogobot and we try to refactor all the non-user-centric-logic out to micro-services.

It also makes more sense that this code will be external, without cluttering the application with more code.

### Plugins support (0.2.0)

One of the things for the soon coming version of Evigilo is plugin support.

Basically, you will be able to switch out the underlying DB with anything that you want as long as you implement (or choose not to) the methods that query it.

For example: One of the things we are doing is storing all the objects on AWS::S3 as well, for persistence, backup, analysis at a later stage.

 
## Installation and running

### Running the API service

* Clone the repository.
* Run `bundle install`.
* Run `bundle exec rake db:create` in order to create the development and test databases.
* Run `rackup -p 4567` in order to run the web service.

### Running tests

* Running `bundle exec rake` will run the full test suite.

## API

Basic API Endpoints are:

* `/store/:table_name/:id/:action` Stores a change log for that object, returns a version id that you can store wherever you want (or don’t)
* `/versions/:table_name/:id` Get all version of a specific object. Returns a list of versions from the server, no change data.
* `/versions/:version` Get changelog data for a specific version

### Api Terms

To keep consistency, the terms (params) of the API are kept across all the endpoints

* `table_name` Just as it’s name suggest, the table (or collection) name
* `id` Again, pretty self explanatory, pass the id of that row/object, this can be either string/integer, your choice
* `version` The version id you want to query
* `action` DB action relevant, this is a string so you can store anything you want eg: (create, update, delete, upsert)

There are **no manipulations** on the data you pass in, if you send `Users` as the table name, it will be stored as is, same for ids and the data/snapshot JSON.

### Store action

The `store` endpoint requires you to send a `data` field with a JSON format for the changelog of the object.

This is the standard:

```javascript
{
  fieldname: [ was, now ]
}
```

For example:

```javascript
{
    "name": [
        "Avi Tzurel",
        "Avi"
    ],
    "perishable_token": [
        "XXXXX",
        "YYYY"
    ],
    "updated_at": [
        "2014-12-21T19:07:25Z",
        "2014-12-22T07:49:49Z"
    ]
}
```

`snapshot


### Store Change

#### POST `/store/:table_name/:id/:action`

SAMPLE POST:

```shell
curl \
  -X POST \
  "http://localhost:4567/store/users/1/create"  \
  -F "data={\"name\":[\"Avi Tzurel\",\"Avi\"],\"perishable_token\":[\"XXXXX\",\"YYYYY\"],\"updated_at\":[\"2014-12-21T19:07:25Z\",\"2014-12-22T07:49:49Z\"]}"
```

SAMPLE RESPONSE:

```javascript
{
    "result": true,
    "version": "3d4415f0-baff-4ba9-bc70-11a95493dfb2"
}
```

`result` field will be true of the version was indeed saved correctly to the database and false if it wasn’t

#### GET `/versions/:table_name/:id`

Will return all versions (or empty array)

SAMPLE GET:

```shell
curl -X GET 'http://localhost:4567/versions/users/1'
```

SAMPLE RESPONSE:

```javascript
{
    "result": "ok",
    "versions": [
        "d0568dc7-4b89-4542-ad16-7b1b9d252e2b",
        "06bdfc59-e261-4c43-b25e-8df69a17423c",

        "3d4415f0-baff-4ba9-bc70-11a95493dfb2"
    ]
}
```

#### GET `/versions/:version`

SAMPLE REQUEST: 

```shell
curl -X GET 'http://localhost:4567/versions/8a2a0d15-698b-4b1c-b78c-4f6898b55a47'
```

```javascript
{
    "result": "ok",

    "object_id": "1",
    "data": {
        "name": [
            "Avi",
            "NewAvi"
        ]
