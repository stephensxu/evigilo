Evigilo is a minimalist API to store/track your database changes.

Evigilo is specifically designed to be used as a microservice with **zero** dependencies on your current application.

## Why?

### Why not use papertrail or any other db-centric solution?

#### Micro Service
We already have a pretty extensive messaging infrastructure at Gogobot and we try to refactor all the non-user-centric-logic out to micro-services.

It also makes more sense that this code will be external, without cluttering the application with more code.

#### Flexible

You can use whatever you want to track changes in your app:

You can tail logs and POST them to the API, you can use curl, you can use the [gogobot/evigilo_api_consumer](https://github.com/gogobot/evigilo_api_consumer), you have all the flexibility you need to make it count.


#### Database agnostic

You can track changes on all your databases (MySQL, Postgres, Mongo, Ms-SQL), as long as you send the `data` field, you can track simply anything you’d like.

#### Pluggable

Next on the Roadmap is to make it pluggable so you can ship the changelog anywhere you want or use a different storage engine (more to come on this soon)


### Plugins support (0.2.0)

One of the things for the soon coming version of Evigilo is plugin support.

Basically, you will be able to switch out the underlying DB with anything that you want as long as you implement (or choose not to) the methods that query it.

For example: One of the things we are doing is storing all the objects on AWS::S3 as well, for persistence, backup, analysis at a later stage.

One more extremely useful plugin is to forward the changes to a stream using `kafka` `kinesis` or any other stream processing solution.

The goal for the plugins is to have all the flexibility so you’ll be able to make it your own and make it work for your application.

If you have plugin suggestion, feel free to open a PR/issue.

 
## Installation and running

### Running the API service

* Clone the repository.
* Run `bundle install`.
* Run and follow the prompt:
```shell
createuser -P --interactive evigilo
Enter password for new role:
Enter it again:
Shall the new role be a superuser? (y/n) n
Shall the new role be allowed to create databases? (y/n) y
Shall the new role be allowed to create more new roles? (y/n) n
```
* Run `bundle exec rake db:create` in order to create the development and test databases.
* Run `rackup -p 4567` in order to run the web service.

### Running tests

* Running `bundle exec rake` will run the full test suite.

## API

Basic API Endpoints are:

* `/store/:table_name/:id/:action` Stores a change log for that object, returns a version id that you can store wherever you want (or don’t)
* `/versions/:table_name/:id` Get all version of a specific object. Returns a list of versions from the server, no change data.
* `/versions/:version` Get changelog data for a specific version

### Api Terms

To keep consistency, the terms (params) of the API are kept across all the endpoints

* `table_name` Just as it’s name suggest, the table (or collection) name
* `id` Again, pretty self explanatory, pass the id of that row/object, this can be either string/integer, your choice
* `version` The version id you want to query
* `action` DB action relevant, this is a string so you can store anything you want eg: (create, update, delete, upsert)

There are **no manipulations** on the data you pass in, if you send `Users` as the table name, it will be stored as is, same for ids and the data/snapshot JSON.


### Deployment

Application is fully compatible with Heroku, you can deploy it to Heroku with just a few easy steps

```shell
$ heroku create <your-selected-application-name>.
$ git push heroku master
$ heroku run rake db:migrate
```

### Store action

The `store` endpoint requires you to send a json in the body with a `data` field that contains the changes.

This is the standard:

```javascript
{
  fieldname: [ was, now ]
}
```

For example:

```javascript
{
    "data": {
        "name": [
            "Avi",
            "NewName"
        ],
        "some_attr": [
            "1",
            "2"
        ],
        "some_other_attr": [
            3,
            5
        ]
    }
}```

`snapshot


### Store Change

#### POST `/store/:table_name/:id/:action`

SAMPLE POST:

```shell
curl \
  -X POST \
  --user test:test \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"data": {"name":["Avi","NewName"],"some_attr":["1","2"],"some_other_attr":[3,5]} }' \
  "http://localhost:4567/store/users/1/create"
```

SAMPLE RESPONSE:

```javascript
{
    "result": true,
    "version": "3d4415f0-baff-4ba9-bc70-11a95493dfb2"
}
```

`result` field will be true of the version was indeed saved correctly to the database and false if it wasn’t

#### GET `/versions/:table_name/:id`

Will return all versions (or empty array)

SAMPLE GET:

```shell
curl --user test:test -X GET 'http://localhost:4567/versions/users/1'
```

SAMPLE RESPONSE:

```javascript
{
    "result": "ok",

        "d0568dc7-4b89-4542-ad16-7b1b9d252e2b",

#### GET `/versions/:version`
